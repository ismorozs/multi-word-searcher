# Multi word searcher
This repository contains source code for [Firefox browser extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-word-searcher/).

To start developing or recreate the current extension build run
```sh
npm install
```
and then
```sh
npm start
```
This will create background and content scripts in the ``./extension`` folder, which contains actual files of the extension.
